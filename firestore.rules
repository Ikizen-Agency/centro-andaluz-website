/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Centro Andaluz de la Habana.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows all authenticated or unauthenticated users full read and write access to all documents,
 * as requested in the user instructions. This is generally discouraged and should only be used in prototyping environments.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event data.
 * - /members/{memberId}: Stores member data.
 * - /blog_posts/{blogPostId}: Stores blog post data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Unrestricted access: All read and write operations are allowed for all users, regardless of authentication state.
 *   This is for prototyping purposes only and is not recommended for production environments.
 *
