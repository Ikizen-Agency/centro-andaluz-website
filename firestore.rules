/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Centro Andaluz de la Habana.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by denying all access, effectively disabling read and write operations to the Firestore database.
 * This is a temporary measure to diagnose a problem, as requested by the user.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database contains three top-level collections: `events`, `members`, and `blog_posts`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * All read and write access is explicitly denied. This ensures that no data can be accessed or modified until more specific rules are implemented.
