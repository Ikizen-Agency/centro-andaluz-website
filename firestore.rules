/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Centro Andaluz de la Habana application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to events, members, and blog posts, but restricts write access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event data, publicly accessible.
 * - /members/{memberId}: Stores member data, publicly accessible.
 * - /blog_posts/{blogPostId}: Stores blog post data, publicly accessible.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access for all collections.
 * - Write access is denied to all users.
