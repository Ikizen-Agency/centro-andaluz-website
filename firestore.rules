/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the Centro Andaluz de la Habana application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to events, members, and blog posts, with no write access granted to any user.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event data.
 * - /members/{memberId}: Stores member data.
 * - /blog_posts/{blogPostId}: Stores blog post data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All collections are publicly readable.
 * - No write operations are permitted, effectively making the data read-only.
