/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Centro Andaluz de la Habana.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides open read access to events, members, and blog posts, while restricting write access to authenticated users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event data.
 * - /members/{memberId}: Stores member data.
 * - /blog_posts/{blogPostId}: Stores blog post data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access for all collections.
 * - Write access is denied to all users, as there is no ownership or role-based access defined.
 * - Listing collections is publicly allowed.
